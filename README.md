# C-PARMACS Implementation of the TPC-C Benchmark

Implementation of the [TPCC Benchmark](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) using C and
[PARMACS macros](http://www.netlib.org/parmacs/). 

This is my bachelor thesis from 2005. The repository has two parts:

* The code for the experiments.
* The [thesis in pdf](https://github.com/graffic/tpcc/raw/master/thesis.pdf) and the TeX sources for the thesis
